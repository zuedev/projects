        <p>
          We're a no-BS milsim community formed on the idea of real fun with
          friends. We don't do training or exams, and we definitely don't do
          "yes sir, no sir." We focus on small-team tactics and play a whole
          bunch of games including Star Citizen and Dungeons & Dragons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our schedule right now is quite sporadic, but we aim to play an Arma 3
          session every 2-3 weeks or so. We use Discord to communicate outside
          of game but extensively use <b>ACRE2</b> and <b>TeamSpeak 3</b> to
          simulate proximity and radio communications in-game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in joining us, feel free to drop by our
          <a href="../discord" target="_blank" style="color: #738adb"
            >Discord</a
          >
          and check out when we're playing next. There should also be a whole
          bunch of other events scheduled between Arma 3 sessions.
