## Homebrew Rules

### Critical Initiative

Getting a critical success on initiative rolls changes their bonus action into a normal action for their first turn, whereas a critical fail restricts them to only movement or an action with no bonus actions.

### Level 1 Extra Feat

All characters are allowed to pick up a racial feat at level 1. For races that don't have racial feats at all, or for those who want to pick a non-racial feat, choose a general feat and discuss it with your DM.

### Lucky Feat Fix

You must declare the use of the Lucky feat before you roll and it grants advantage.

### Modified Help Action

- Characters must be proficient in activities they wish to help another character with.
- When taking the Help action, roll 1d6 and add your proficiency modifier. The character you are helping can add this value to to their roll.

### Potion Toxicity

If a player consumes more than one potion before finishing a long rest, they must make a Constitution saving throw after drinking it. The DC of the saving throw is equal to strength of the potion you drank. If you drink three or more potions before completing a long rest, you have disadvantage on this saving throw.

| Potion Rarity | Potion Toxicity DC |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Common        | 9                  |
| Uncommon      | 11                 |
| Rare          | 13                 |
| Very Rare     | 15                 |
| Legendary     | 17                 |

On a success, their body is able to withstand the residual magic from multiple potions mingling in their body. On a failure, the magic overpowers them. They feel queasy and vomit, taking acid damage equal to 1 + 1d8 per level of rarity of the potion and gain a toxicity effect. For example, a rare potion deals 3d8 + 1 acid damage and applies an effect from the Wild Magic Surge table.

### Quick Potion Drinking

You can use a bonus action, instead of an action, to drink a potion youâ€™re holding.

### Special Actions

You can forgo your movement in a turn to do a special action, these are listed below:

- **Heavy Blow:** Gain advantage on one melee attack this turn.
- **Aimed Shot:** Aim for a specific point, such as a limb, for a specific desired effect.
- **Focused Casting:**
  - **Melee:** Gain advantage on one melee spell attack this turn.
  - **Ranged:** Aim for a specific point, such as a limb, for a specific desired effect.
  - **Saving throw:** Your spell save DC increases by +1.

### Wild Magic Surge Table (Variant)

Any sort of "wild magic" now uses [this table](./revisedWildMagicSurgeTable.md).
