# Getting Started Guide

## The Modpack

Setting up the modpack is easy, but is quite unique from traditional setups. Because of this, we ask that you follow every step in this guide in order to properly download all of the mods and ensure you can jump into sessions without any issues.

We ask you to **please make sure to read all the points before you begin installation.**

### Installing

Oh shit, a video!

1. Subscribe to our setup mod called the **Primary Session Branch** on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092924095), this essentially keeps track of all other required mod items and allows for quick install and update.

2. Open up the ArmA III launcher and select the **Mods** tab and select **Unload All** in the top-right if you have any mods already enabled.

3. Under **Available Mods** enable the **Primary Session Branch** mod and then select the **Load Selected Mods** option to subscribe to and load our entire modpack.

4. Wait for the launcher to download and enable the mods and then youâ€™re all done!

### Updating

Updating the modpack is simple! All you need to do is restart your **ArmA III Launcher**, **Unload All** mods, then reload the **Primary Session Branch** mod you downloaded to begin with.

## Radio Setup (ACRE2)

Installing and setting up ACRE2 is easy! When we use ACRE2 it is automatically installed in our modpack and **once you launch the game it will automatically set up in your TeamSpeak 3 client!** All you need to do is just **enable the plugin** found in **Tools->Options->Addons** of your TS3 client. In case you have TFAR installed **make sure to disable it within the TS3 Client.**

## Configuration

### Disable BattlEye

Make sure you disable Battleye when playing with us! To do this, just open the Arma 3 launcher, go to the "Battleye" option on the left side of it and untick "Enable BattlEye anti-cheat software."

### Controls

#### Grenade Throwing

It is recommended to set the keybinding for grenades (when throwing them) to "double-tapping" the 'g' key.
