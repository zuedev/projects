# classless

A classless CSS framework

## What is this?

I'm really picky with CSS styling, and I like to avoid class-heavy CSS frameworks, so I made this! The main goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, clean-looking, and style-agnostic base that I like the look of.

## What does it look like?
