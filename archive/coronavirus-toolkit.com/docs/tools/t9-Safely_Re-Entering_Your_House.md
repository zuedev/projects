#### Before you come inside

- If possible, avoid hand-contact with door-handles/doorknobs. Use your arm, elbow, or leg to push/pull the door open. Alternatively, use a paper tissue or hand wipe and dispose of it afterwards. If you live in a shared building, such as an apartment block, and there is  an elevator or lift in your building, it should be frequently disinfected. Rugs or mats that are placed in communal areas should be cleaned as well.
- Leave your shoes outside or, if not possible, as close to the door as you can. Once you have your house shoes on, you can clean the floor under the shoes and where the shopping or other bag was placed with a cloth or mop and an soap / detergent. If you touch the shoes, wash your hands afterwards.

  - **Do not** put them on any surface such as a chair or table near where you prepare food
  - **Do** put them down at the entrance outside or, if not possible, inside your household in an area separate from where you normally prepare food.

#### Groceries and Other Items Brought Inside the House

- **Packaging** may have been contaminated by dirty hands. Even though the virus causing the disease cannot survive in the open air for more than three hours, you can take additional precautions by cleaning the packaging using a clean damp cloth or single-use paper towel. It is not necessary to use bleach.
- **Dispose of any non-essential packaging** and wipe those that you cannot remove, such as yoghurt containers, with a damp cloth or single-use paper towel. Hands should be washed thoroughly before and after removing the packaging. Thoroughly wash food items such as fruit and vegetables.
  - General hygiene rules should be followed
- **Fruit and vegetables** should be washed thoroughly after purchase and before cooking and eating them. Clean water is sufficient. It is not necessary to use disinfectant or bleach as they can be toxic if not rinsed away properly. Nor is it necessary to use white wine vinegar. After washing with clean water, wipe with a single-use paper towel to remove any remaining viral particles. This is especially important where fruit or vegetables are to be eaten raw.
- **Cooking vegetables** at a temperature of 63 degrees centigrade / 145 degrees Farenheit, medium heat, is enough to destroy any virus that might be present. There is no need to overcook food. Fruit or vegetables that are to be eaten raw should be wasted in clean water should be sufficient to reduce transmission of the virus by cross contamination i.e. the risk of the virus being spread through contact with hands.

#### Returning from Walking Dogs or Other Animals

Dogs or other household pets that need to be walked should be taken outside with the intention of social distancing (maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others). Pets should not interact or play with those from other households at this time, as they may transmit Coronavirus to their owners from other sources.

If you have been walking your dog, on your return, consider cleaning its paws with water and soap.
