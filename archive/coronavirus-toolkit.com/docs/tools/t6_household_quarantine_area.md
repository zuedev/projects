### Why is this Important?

If you or a loved one has symptoms of coronavirus, with or without a confirmed test for the virus, you will need to create a separate space in the home for yourself or the person(s) you are caring for to **prevent the spread of infection among your household**.

**If you live alone**, make sure that your friends and neighbors on your emergency contact list are aware of your symptoms, so they can check in on you. Of course they will still need to follow isolation guidelines to do that.

### What You Need

**Quarantine space for the person(s) with coronavirus symptoms**

* **Best:** A separate room per person who needs to be isolated with access to a bathroom not used by anyone else
* **Good:** A separate room for people who need to be isolated
* **Adequate:** An area screened off from other people in the household
* **Inadequate:** No attempt to provide physical barriers at all

**Caretaker for the person(s) in quarantine**

Someone in your household should act as the agreed caretaker for the person(s) in quarantine. Avoid anyone who is considered vulnerable or unable or unwilling to adhere to isolation guidelines.

**Equipment to Manage the Quarantine**

* Sheets and Blankets
* Towels
* Clothing
* Personal care items (eg wash kit, tampons)
* Tissues
* Hand sanitizer
* Portable toilet (if available and the household does not have access to a bathroom with a toilet just for person(s) in quarantine)
* Cleaning supplies
* Trash bags

**Things to Help the Person in the Quarantine Space Cope**

Expect the infected individual to spend the majority of their time here. Providing a television, books and magazines, a mobile phone or tablet or other means of entertainment, if possible, may help them to pass the time and stay positive. Many providers of video chat services are providing special deals  during the pandemic – quarantine does not mean everyone should not communicate with each other regularly, they just need to do it in a way that minimizes risk of spread.

**No separate room(s)?**

If space is not available to prepare a separate room, separate the infected individual’s space as much as possible from any other communal space in a dwelling, and continue to practice frequent handwashing, disinfection, and isolation with the use of gloves and masks. Continue to follow CDC, WHO or your local health department’s recommended practices to prevent the spread of infection.

If you have no separate room, the sites below show you how to build your own quarantine area with some basic tools.

### Separate clothes and bedding for washing

In addition to keeping personal care items separate, infected individuals should have a separate space to handle their soiled clothing and linens.

* **Bag washing separately:** Have the infected individual gather soiled clothing, bed linens, and towels in trash bags or a washable laundry bag to contain contamination
* **Wash with precautions:** Caretakers may then handle a closed bag with gloves, and enclose it in another bag before immediately transporting it to the laundry area, where all items should be washed with detergent in the hottest water recommended
* **Cleanse hands:** Caretakers should clean gloves and hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer afterwards and disinfect any hard surfaces (see below)

### Disinfect

Disinfect any space every time the infected individual uses it. This is especially important if the space is in a shared area. Use a CDC recommended disinfectant, or whatever your government recommends:

* **Bleach solution:** 5 tablespoons (approximately 100 ml, 1/3 cup) of bleach per gallon (approximately 4.5 liters) of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water. **Never mix with ammonia or any other cleanser and provide proper ventilation. Do not use anything past its expiration date.**
* **Alcohol solution:** must be at least 70%.
* Use the disinfectant to clean all high-touch surfaces in the shared area: counters, door handles/knobs, switches, toilet flush handle, toilet lid, shower/bathtub handles, shower curtain, towel rack, medicine cabinet, sinks and faucets/taps, appliances, remote controls, electronic devices, etc..
* Apply the disinfectant and allow it to air dry.
* **Do not share towels or wipes used for disinfecting patient areas with other areas of the house. This may spread contamination.**

### Don’t Share Common Items

Avoiding the use of shared spaces and items is important in preventing the spread of infection. In some cases, families and/or roommates may not be able to separate their shared spaces. Whether you can provide a separate space for a sick individual or not, a household with an infected individual should not share items such as:

* Toothbrushes
* Utensils
* Disinfecting wipes
* Towels
* Dishes
* Cups
* Handkerchiefs or tissues

### Household Pets

Household **pets should not be cared for, played with or petted by an infected individual** because this increases the risk of transmitting the virus to other people who also pet that animal.
