### Why is the Tool Helpful to You

During the pandemic many of us have been asked to work from home. For some of us, this may already be part of our normal routine; for others this may be something new that we are not accustomed to doing. Working from home or working remotely may be challenging during this period as we may find it difficult to develop a routine and a balanced day. We may also have to consider the presence of other household members. This toolkit aims to provide you with some strategies for effectively working from home.

### What You Need

### What you Need to do

1. **Be aware of any existing guidance from your employer** - If your employer or workplace has guidelines for remote working, review them first so that you are aware of your employer's regulations, any technology required and expectations.

2. **Create a workspace** - identify a room or area in your house that you can use as a substitute office space. Defining a dedicated area in the home for work, helps to motivate you and mentally prepare you that it is time to work.

3. **Set your working hours** - creating a schedule and establishing working hours helps to provide structure to your workday. It may be useful to make the schedule a day in advance or create a schedule for the entire work week. In this way, other household members will be aware of the work week. You can also schedule personal time alongside your work schedule so that you can create a balanced day.

4. If you also have flexible work hours (where you can work on your own time), then try to schedule your work around the hours where you are likely to be most productive. For example, if you are a morning a person, then prioritize important work tasks for this period. There may also be a risk of over-working while at home. Therefore, it is essential that you identify a time that marks the end of the workday.

5. **Take scheduled breaks** - once you have set your working hours and created a schedule, it is also necessary to ensure that you schedule breaks into your workday. If you routinely take breaks (eg. Coffee breaks, lunch) at your regular workplace, then you should incorporate a similar routine at home. Taking breaks can improve your productivity and effectiveness in your job role. If there are other members in the household, you can schedule these breaks at the same time that other members may be on a break themselves or having lunch.

6. **Try to eliminate/reduce distractions** - in household lockdown this means that other family members will be at home too. This increases your chances of being distracted and being unable to complete your work. You should ensure that everyone at home is aware of your working hours and let them know not to disturb you during those hours unless it is an emergency. If you are in a room with a door, consider hanging a 'do not disturb' sign on the door.

7. **Dress as if you are actually going to work** - while the benefit of working from home is that you do not have to wear formal work clothes, this action may also trick you into thinking you don't have to work. Dressing as you would normally dress for your job helps to mentally prepare you for the work day. It's also necessary if you are having video meetings to still ensure that you appear professional to your colleagues.

8. **Communication** - ensure that there is an established mode of communication with your colleagues and that there are set times when to call or send emails. Staying connected by phone, email or video ensures that you are up to date with any new developments at work.

9. **General work practices** - if you are working at a laptop or computer for long hours, try to take micro-breaks every 30 minutes to stretch or get something to drink. Use a headset/earphones rather than holding your phone in your hand and against your face. If there are others in the household, remember to mute your microphone when you are not speaking.

10. If you are struggling to work from home, it is important that you communicate this with your employer so that you can both develop a plan to address the problem.
