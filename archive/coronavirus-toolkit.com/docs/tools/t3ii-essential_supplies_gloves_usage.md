### Why is this Tool Helpful to You?
COVID-19 is known to be transmitted via droplets occurring naturally when we breathe and it is thought to be transmitted in gaseous clouds of virus associated with breathing and speaking. Experts also think that transmission can happen if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. This tool will help clarify the situations when gloves are a sensible precaution to protect you or others in your household from COVID-19 through contact with the virus with hands.

### What You Need

**Preferred:** non sterile medical gloves

**Acceptable:** reusable gloves/rubber gloves (e.g. dish-washing / washing-up gloves)

### Should I Wear Gloves?

#### When Leaving the House - No

**In summary:** it is not necessary to wear gloves when out in public. Make sure you wash your hands regularly and do not touch your face. 

**Medical Gloves – No.** There is no strong evidence that recommends that you should wear medical gloves when leaving the house or while traveling on public transport.

Medical gloves are helpful in reducing transmission of pathogens like COVID-19 in healthcare workers, but at the same time they do not provide complete protection. 

When leaving the house, it is fundamental to wash your hands regularly and / or use alcohol gel solution at the first available opportunity. Using gloves is unnecessary and can also lead to an increased risk of germ transmission, if not used correctly.

Medical gloves usage does not represent an alternative to hand washing, which is the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

**Reusable gloves/rubber gloves – No.** Wearing rubber gloves while out is not recommended. Unfortunately, you can still contract the virus.
