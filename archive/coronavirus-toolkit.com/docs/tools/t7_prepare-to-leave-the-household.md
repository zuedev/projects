### Why is this Important?

While many people are under Stay-At-Home orders during the Coronavirus pandemic, there still may be a need to leave the household to go to work as someone in the essential services, purchase groceries, pick up prescription medications, exercise, or walk the dog. If you need to leave your home for any reason, you will need to be prepared with the proper tools to do so, including how to socially distance.

### Before Leaving

- **Do not go out if you are vulnerable or have symptoms of coronavirus:** review [T10: Check Severity of Coronavirus Symptoms](/f2-living-in-a-household-with-someone-with-coronavirus-symptoms.html#T10-Coronavirus-symptom-severity-checker), and contact your health care provider for what to do if symptoms are concerning or worsen rapidly.
- **Cleanse Hands/Disinfect Items:** Thoroughly wash hands with soap and water as well as disinfect anything that may be handled by others that has been in your home. Whether you are living with or caring for an infected person, you may or may not be an asymptomatic carrier. Take care to prevent the unknowing spread of the virus to other individuals.
- **Bring only Necessary Items:** Bring only what you need with you, to reduce the items that carry and may potentially come into contact with an infected individual. Prepare your reusable bags for grocery shopping if applicable.
- **Always Have Sanitizer:** Sanitizer will be more useful than gloves. Always carry it with you and frequently use it on your hands. If you do not have hand sanitizer, follow handwashing guidelines when you return home
- **Prepare NOT to Touch Your Face:** As silly as it sounds, think about this. Once you leave the house, you should not under any circumstances touch your face, as you could transfer virus particles from items you touch and end up infecting yourself and possibly your household.
- **Wear a Mask:** People without symptoms but with the virus can still infect others. Wear a mask to prevent possible transmission to others or possible infection yourself.

### Preparing to Walk Dogs

Dogs or other household pets that need to be walked should be taken outside with the intention of social distancing (maintaining at least 6 feet / 2 metres of distance between yourself and others). Where possible, pets should not interact or play with those from other households at this time, as they may transmit Coronavirus to their owners from other sources.
