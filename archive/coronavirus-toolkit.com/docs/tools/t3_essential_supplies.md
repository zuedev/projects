### Rationale for Tool

If we have enough essential supplies in the house for a period of lock-down we reduce the risk to our household and community by having to leave the house to replenish them.
We could find no commonly agreed definition for what constitutes 'essential' in the context of the coronavirus epidemic across multiple countries. We reference some sources and have categorized essential supplies under three areas.

### What You Need

When in doubt about whether something is essential, ask yourself, *"Can our household do without it for the next 14 days?"*. Deciding to leave your household for a non-essential item increases the risk of spread to your household unnecessarily. This list does not include anything to keep everyone entertained while isolated or in lock-down. Whatever you do for entertainment, remember the principles of social distancing.

### Health & Medication

(adapted from [Government of Canada guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html))

* Essential medication for everyone in the household
* Face masks (Best=N95; Good=disposable face masks; Adequate=home made masks; Inadequate=no face mask)
* Eye protection (Best=Goggles or a face shield; Adequate=Glasses or sunglasses; Inadequate=contact lenses, since they increase the risk of hand-to-eye contact, or no protection)
* Gloves (Best=disposable gloves; Good=rubber dish washing gloves; Adequate=other gloves)
* Cleaning Cloths (Best=disposable paper towel, toilet roll or tissue that is disposed in a waste container after a single use; Adequate=reusable cloth suitable for high temperature wash that must be soaked in diluted bleach prior to washing and washed at high temperature between reuses)
* Waste container (Best=with plastic liner; Good=no liner, but cleaned every day with disinfectant or diluted bleach)
* Thermometer
* Plastic sheeting and strong tape (to construct an 'isolation zone' in the event a member of the household develops symptoms, particularly if your household cannot isolate someone in a separate room)

### Cleaning & Hygiene

(adapted from [Government of Canada guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html))

* Hand soap
* Alcohol-based sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol
* Dish soap / washing up soap
* Regular laundry soap / detergent
* Regular household cleaning products
* Store bought disinfectant
* Bleach and a separate container for dilution
* Alcohol prep wipes

### Food & Drink

**Food:** Sufficient non-perishable food for everyone in the household for the duration of lock-down. ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/expert-how-to-stockpile-healthy-food-14-day-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-2))
* Manual can opener

**Drink:** The large majority of countries have access to clean tap water. Irrespective of this, it is worth filling a few clean containers with clean tap water and storing them in a cool, dry and dark place in case there are intermittent problems with water supply. One gallon (4 liters) per person should be sufficient for short supply outages. More if you anticipate longer outages. Follow your country guidance for sterilizing water if water-born illness is a known risk.
