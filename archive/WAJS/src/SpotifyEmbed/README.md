# SpotifyEmbed

SpotifyEmbed allows you to embed a Spotify player with your choice of song, album, or playlist!

## How to use

Load the code and edit the `settings` constant at the top of the file. You will need to know the embed link of whatever you want to embed, for example:

![](example.gif)

In this example, my `settings` will look like this:

```js
const settings = {
  embedSrc: "https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3E9Wv5hNRwedUjPkkplcx4"
};
```

And done!

## Future Plans

- [ ] Same thing, but with YouTube
- [ ] Volume control?
