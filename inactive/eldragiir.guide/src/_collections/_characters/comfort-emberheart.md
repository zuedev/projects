## Timeline

### [980POC 23/4 3:00] Comfort's Birth

Comfort was born to two Cind parents, his mother, named "Peace," and his father, "Guidance."

His father was the spiritual leader of the Dustborn clan, bearing the title of "Father Superior." This title was hereditary, and therefore, Comfort was also destined from birth to lead his kin through spiritual enlightenment; he was a prince, of sorts. Peace, Comfort's mother, held the title of "Mother Protector," a role tasked with the responsibility of raising and protecting the child of the current Father Superior.

Unfortunately, Guidance had to leave very early in Comfort's life to go on a vision-quest of enlightenment, an ancient tradition that involved a pilgrimage to the four temples of the elements across The Blightlands, meaning Comfort's childhood was mainly spent with his mother.

On his 13th birthday, the migrant convoy of caravans Comfort called home was atatcked by a horde of demons.

The guardians of the clan, a band of legendary warriors called The Storm-Breakers, left the caravan to intercept the demonic force. However, some lowly demons were able to break through after dispelling the runes of protection that were placed behind The Storm-Breakers' defensive line. This alone was enough to catch the caravans completely off-guard and multiple families were killed in the massacre that followed.

Comfort heard his friends and their families crying out, and had to force himself free from his mother's arms to leave their hiding spot. He ran towards the closest caravan that had a demon assaulting it and used the only real techniques he was ever taught, firebolt and fireskin, to hurt the demon enough to make it retreat. But, upon looking into the caravan, he was immediately attacked by the very friend he was trying to save. Using a chef's knife, the other young Cinds slashed at Comfort, inflicting enough damage to make him fall unconscious.

This is the last thing Comfort remembers clearly about that day, but to his ignorance, Guidance, Comfort's father, returned to the clan on the day of the attack and, armed with his new knowledge of the elements, single-handedly protected the rest of the caravans shortly after Comfort fell. His father used a powerful spell to return Comfort's soul to it's body, forever cursing his father by stripping him of all his magic. Still unconscious, Comfort was taken to an ancient gateway to the material plane by The Storm-Breakers under instruction of Guidance, where he was left with ample supplies to start his life anew in a world that was not cursed with Blight.

### [999POC 19/11 06:30] Nostro Revolution

Comfort's life in the material plane was wrought with strife as Cinds were considered evil by the common human. Due to this, he found it very difficult to find his place in the world, choosing to travel far and wide to try and find a place he could call home.

After a few months of travelling around Gil'brun, he came across the port-town of Nostro, a bustling trade hub that splintered-off from The Empire over a decade before. Though independent from it, Nostro was still forced to comply with The Empire's laws and trading regulations, of which prohibited both Goblins and Cinds from applying for a trader's license. This meant a lot of the residents of Nostro couldn't earn a living without turning to trading on black markets and other illigitimate forms of earning coin, which only further ruined their reputation.

Seeing this endless cycle of hatred towards his and other species caused something to finally snap within Comfort, and in a blind rage, he challenged and defeated the Empire-assigned guardsmen with the aid of a gang of other warriors. Upon hearing of this rally for change and the resistance that was rising within the town, The Empire dispatched an entire legion to control the revolution. By the time the legion arrived to the town, the revolutionary forces had grown enough to pose a serious enough threat to them, and an impromptu siege of the town took place.

During the siege, Comfort was able to command a force of veterans that he augmented with fireskin to cleave directly through the legion's defensive line\*, a tactic previously thought impossible, which was enough of a blow to force the legion to retreat. Shortly after this battle, Bastion (the Empire-controlled capital of Gil'brun), declared that Nostro was to be truly independent from The Empire, allowing those of all origins to make a living by legitimate trade.

Shortly after his victory in Nostro, Comfort and his band of veteran warriors completely vanished from the newly-reformed town, but has promised to return if they were ever in need of aid.

\*_These veterans were later known as "fire warriors", and have maintained a staple of Comfort's anti-Empire forces and tactics._
