The toolkit is made up of **Focus** and **Tools**.

A Focus helps people find the appropriate tools quickly and comprises multiple Tools. We plan to release a new Focus every week.

## What is the Coronavirus Toolkit?

![The Toolkit: How is it put together?](/Facebook-cover.jpg)

### Goal

> On 7 April 2020, in an effort to establish a cohesive identity for the initiative, we agreed to call the group **'Practical Reviews of Evidence - Volunteers Against Covid-19'** or **'P.R.E.V.A.C.'**

The goal of PREVAC is to develop a free, pragmatic, evidence-based toolkit for all, to encourage and sustain behavior that will combat the spread and impact of COVID-19, regardless of who you are or where you live in the world.

The objective for the toolkit is to bring together what every household needs to know to keep themselves as safe as possible from infection, and minimise any risk they may pose to others. Until proven vaccines and treatments are available, the contents of the toolkit will not be complicated; the biggest challenge now is helping us all change our behavior to keep us and our loved ones safe in the face of the crisis.

### How Can You Help Now?

We are seeking volunteers who are motivated to contribute and have skills and experience in accessing and influencing the target audience, which, in this case, is just about everybody on earth. Please follow us – and please tell everyone about what we’re doing. This toolkit could make all the difference to you and the communities you live in.

### Call for Volunteers

If you think you have skills to help us achieve this, please contact the team now. We may not be able to respond immediately as we’re working on the toolkit right now, but we will get back to you as soon as we can. If you feel that you are in a position to endorse or promote the toolkit, we’d love to hear from you too.

**Volunteers:** <coronavirustoolkit@gmail.com>

### Call for Group or Organizational Action

If you are a group or organization with a similar objective, we would love to hear from you. Please be clear with any communication, because the team is too busy to respond to requests for funding or product endorsement and we will simply ignore the communication.

**Groups:** <coronavirustoolkit@gmail.com>

### How Did the Initiative Come About?

John Kerrigan, a concerned member of the public who has some relevant background, started this initiative on Saturday 21 March.

> _“Everyone, me included, is anxious about COVID-19 and wants to do the right thing for their families and friends. Back in 2000 my company produced a toolkit to make it easy for doctors to follow clinical practice guidelines. I’m applying the lessons I learned then to do the same thing for households doing whatever they can to help in this crisis.”_

The first volunteers met online on Monday 23 March 2020.

This is non-paid commitment from a motivated team of volunteers from all walks of life and we have no sponsorship from any establishment.
