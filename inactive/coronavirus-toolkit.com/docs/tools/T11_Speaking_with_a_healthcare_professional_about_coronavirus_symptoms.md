### Why is the Tool Helpful to You

It is useful if you prepare yourself ahead of time by considering what questions your healthcare professional may ask you.  This tool aims to prepare you for that conversation with your healthcare professional.

- What was the length of time of your interaction with that person?
- Is anyone else in the same household unwell?
