### Why is this Tool Helpful to You?

Face masks reduce the spread of virus due to coughing, breathing and talking. Physical barriers like masks are the most effective tool against COVID-19.

### What You Need

**Preferred:** Surgical mask or homemade HEPA-filter-based mask

**Acceptable:** Other homemade mask (bandana / old scarf / old towel / old t-shirt / 2 elastic bands [+ optional coffee filter])

**Unacceptable:** No mask

### Should I Wear a Mask?

**When leaving the house – Yes.**

**When at home and you are symptomatic or have had recent contact with someone with COVID-19 – Yes.**

**When at home and you have been in lock-down for greater than 14 days and no one at home has symptoms – No.**

There is no harm in wearing a mask covering your face, and it is believed to prevent droplets and a gaseous cloud containing the virus traveling up to 8 meters / 27 feet.

- COVID-19 is transmitted in droplets or a gaseous cloud exhaled by an individual infected with COVID-19
  - These droplets can travel 2 meters or 6 feet away from the individual
  - A gaseous cloud can travel for up to 8 meters / 27 feet
- A mask covering the nose and mouth will prevent or dramatically reduce COVID-19 transmission
- Masks can discourage face-touching, which also protects you against COVID-19
- Masks are **only effective** when used in combination with frequent hand washing/sanitizing, social distancing, and avoiding face-touching
- You **must** wear a mask when caring for someone suspected of having COVID-19 or if you exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 and must leave the house (e.g. to get tested)
- You **should** wear a mask if you may come into contact with people
- Children under the age of 2, people who have trouble breathing, are unconscious, or are incapacitated **should not** wear a facemask due to risk of suffocation

### Types of Commercial Masks

- Surgical masks are sufficient to prevent COVID-19 transmission
  - The majority of hospital staff use surgical masks when caring for COVID-19 patients
- N95 and FFP3 masks are **not more effective** at preventing respiratory illness transmission than surgical masks ([Greenhalgh and Chan](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-efficacy-of-standard-face-masks-compared-to-respirator-masks-in-preventing-covid-type-respiratory-illnesses-in-primary-care-staff/))
  - N95 and FFP3 masks only provide increased protection when doctors are working directly with the airway (e.g. intubation, bronchoscopy); N95 or FFP3 masks are often **only** worn by healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients during these procedures ([Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/updated-ipac-measures-covid-19.pdf), [UK PPE Guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#ppe-guidance-by-healthcare-context) – see Section 8)
  - Members of the public will not be exposed to this increased risk
  - We do not recommend using N95 masks as it provides you with no additional protection and pulls supply away from essential healthcare workers

### Home Made Masks

- Home Made cloth masks can be similarly effective to a surgical mask if worn correctly
  - Ensure your household has at least 2 homemade masks to prevent reuse

#### Basic Mask

- The CDC has 3 different guides for making a homemade mask: sewn cloth, quick cut t-shirt, and bandana face covering—shown below ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) guide and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPx1yqvJgf4) from the US Surgeon General)
  - Cotton cloth is preferable to other types of fabric

#### Advanced Mask:

- For someone with more time and materials, here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6d3twpHwis&amp;feature=youtu.be) and [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fW_Qrv_1J26Lgd1kawSWqqyKvbYOY2Fu/view) explaining how to construct a safe face mask from a HEPA filter from a vacuum cleaner bag. It is also recommended that these should be donated to local emergency services.

### Putting On Masks

Adapted from [WHO Guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)

- Wash your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water for 20 seconds before putting on a mask
- Cover the mouth and nose with the mask and **ensure there are no gaps** between your face and the mask

### Removing Masks

Adapted from [WHO Guidelines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)

- Remove the mask by removing it from behind, pulling the straps over the ears so that the mask falls forward
- **Do not** touch the front of the mask as it may be contaminated with COVID-19
- Surgical Masks: immediately dispose of them in a closed trash bin
- Cloth Masks: immediately place in a separate bag after use and set aside for washing in your washing machine
- Wash your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water for 20 seconds

### Reusing Masks

- Commercial masks (surgical masks) **should not be reused** and should be disposed of immediately after use
- Cloth masks **can** be reused but must be cleaned or sterilized before reuse. There are a number of methods available, listed in order of preference:
- A washing machine using laundry detergent on the hot water setting (greater than 70°C/160°F)
- Soak in 1-part bleach in 50 parts hot water (greater than 70°C/160°F) for greater than 5 minutes, then rinse with water
  - This means 2 tablespoons or 20mL of bleach per liter of water, or 1/3 of a cup bleach per gallon of water
- Masks should be hung to air-dry
