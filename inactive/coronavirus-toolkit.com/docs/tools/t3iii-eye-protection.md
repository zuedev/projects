### Why is this Tool Helpful to You?
Eye protection reduces the spread of virus due to coughing, breathing and talking. Physical barriers like face-shields or goggles can also protect against COVID-19 infection.

### What You Need
**Preferred:** Plastic safety goggles or a face shield

**Somewhat Effective:** Wrap-around sunglasses, safety glasses

**No evidence that they are effective:** Prescription glasses, normal sunglasses

**Not Effective:** No eye protection

#### Should I Wear Eye Protection?
**When leaving the house – Yes.**

**When at home and you are symptomatic or have had recent contact with someone with COVID-19 – Yes.**

**When at home and you have been in lock-down for greater than 14 days and no one at home has symptoms – No.**

There is no harm in wearing eye protection, and it is believed to prevent droplets and a gaseous cloud containing the virus traveling up to 8 meters / 27 feet from reaching the eyes, which can cause infection.

- COVID-19 is transmitted in droplets or a gaseous cloud exhaled by an individual infected with COVID-19
  - These droplets can travel 2 meters or 6 feet away from the individual
  - A gaseous cloud can travel for up to 8 meters / 27 feet

- Eye protection will prevent or reduce COVID-19 transmission through droplets contacting the eyes
  - Eye protection also discourages eye-rubbing, which also protects you against COVID-19
- Eye protection is **only effective** when used in combination with other personal protective equipment (PPE), frequent hand washing/sanitizing, social distancing, and avoiding face-touching
- You are **strongly advised** to wear eye protection when caring for someone suspected of having COVID-19 or if you exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 and must leave the house (e.g. to get tested)
- You **should** wear eye protection if you may come into contact with people
- Contact lenses are **safe to wear**, but are **not protective** and must be disinfected between uses (like prescription glasses) when leaving the house or in contact with someone suspected of having COVID-19

#### Types of Eye Protection

- Face shields or plastic safety goggles are sufficient to prevent COVID-19 transmission
  - The majority of hospital staff use face shields when caring for COVID-19 patients [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#ppe-guidance-by-healthcare-context)

  - Plastic safety goggles may also be worn by hospital staff when face shields are limiting or when using microscopes [Public Health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/updated-ipac-measures-covid-19.pdf?la=en)
- Safety goggles or wrap-around sunglasses can provide limited eye protection
- Prescription glasses or normal sunglasses have large gaps between the lenses and the face, and thus provide inadequate protection
  - There is no evidence that normal glasses provide significant protection against COVID-19

#### Reusing Eye Protection
- Eye protection must be cleaned between uses:
  1. Hand wash with hot water (greater than 70°C/160°F) and dish soap for about 1 minute, then rinse and dry before disinfecting with store bought disinfectant cleaning solution or disinfecting wipes
  2. Soak in 1-part bleach to 50 parts of hot water (greater than 70°C/160°F) for greater than 5 minutes, then rinse with water
      - This means 2 tablespoons or 20mL of bleach per liter of water, or 1/3 of a cup bleach per gallon of water
- Eye protection should be dried with disposable paper towel or air dried
- Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub after cleaning eye protection
- Any prescription glasses or contact lenses should also be cleaned or disinfected often
