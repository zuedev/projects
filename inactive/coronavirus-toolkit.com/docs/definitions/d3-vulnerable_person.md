## Vulnerable or 'at-risk' person

There are two possible meanings for these terms. One of them refers to people that have a **higher risk of getting infected** with coronavirus, taking into account their common surroundings and interaction with other people - e.g. Health professionals, people who are caring for a sick person), while the other considers the **risk of developing a severe illness** if infection with Covid-19 occurs, which is higher for older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions. A clear-cut definition of the conditions which contribute to a higher risk of severe illness is not easy to establish, but in general terms the CDC considers:

- People 65 years and older;
- People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility;
- People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, including:
  - People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
  - People who have serious heart conditions
  - People who are immunocompromised
  - Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications
  - People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher)
  - People with diabetes
  - People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis
  - People with liver disease
