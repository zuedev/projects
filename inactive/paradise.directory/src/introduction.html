title: Introduction
description: The remnants of a dead galaxy torn apart by an long-past intergalactic conflict that bathed it's planets in nuclear winter and biological horror. Thousands of warring factions now fight to win themselves the ultimate prize of a lucreship, a hulking relic of old that was used to bring ruin to entire star-systems, now safe-havens for the savvy survivor or terrifying war-machines for the deranged dictator.
